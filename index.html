    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[First and formal, I'll tell the client the importans of keeping the softweare and system fully up to date.
        Oftentimes cyber attacks happen because of weaknesses in a system or softweare that isn't up to date.
        I would recomend HTTPS format, rather than HTTP and this is because this means that the communication between the server and client is encrypted using TLS or SSl, something that gives us a more secure option.
        To have updated any extensions or plugins you have is extremely important, same with a two factor authentication also known as 2FA will help withe the security of the webpage.
        A secure and safe hosting service is one of the best options you can do for your website/business. This option does not only protect the site from attacks from malware and hackers, it means that the site is alwaysbeing monitored and it minimise any downtime.]</p>
